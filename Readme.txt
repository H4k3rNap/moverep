Bash Directory Navigator Script

This Bash script provides a simple interactive directory navigator. It lists directories in the current directory, assigns them incremental numbers, prompts the user to choose a directory by entering the corresponding number, and then changes to the selected directory. The script continues this process until the user decides to exit.

Execute:

bash moverep.sh

# 1. Desktop
# 2. Documents
# 3. Images
# 4. Mod√®les
# 5. Music
# 6. Public
# 7. Download
# 8. Videos

Choose a directory number [Enter to quit ...]

Usage:

Features:

Interactive directory listing with numbered options.
User input validation for selecting directories.

Note:

The script uses (cd ... && echo "You are now in: $(pwd)") to change directories and display the new path within the same process.
